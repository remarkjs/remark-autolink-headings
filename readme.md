# remark-autolink-headings

**Stability: Legacy**.
This package is no longer recommended for use.
It’s still covered by semantic-versioning guarantees and not yet deprecated,
but use of this package should be avoided.
Please use `remark-rehype` to move from remark (markdown) to rehype (HTML)
and then replace `remark-autolink-headings` with
[`rehype-autolink-headings`][rehype-autolink-headings].

Legacy [documentation for this package](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-autolink-headings/tree/91254a60bfe03163cb49f08ec20ca5d34f677b7c)
is still available in Git.
